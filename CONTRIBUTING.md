### Steps to Contribute Code

Follow the following steps to ensure your contribution goes smoothly.

1. Read and follow the steps outlined in the [Daytona Contributing Policy](README.md#contributing).
1. Configure your development environment by either following the guide below.
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/) the GitHub Repository allowing you to make the changes in your own copy of the repository.
1. Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/issues) if one doesn't exist already.  
1. [Prepare your changes](/PREPARING_YOUR_CHANGES.md) and ensure your commits are descriptive. The document contains an optional commit template, if desired.
1. Ensure that you are in the [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file (see the [Adding Yourself to the Contributors List](#adding-yourself-to-the-contributors-list) section for instructions)
1. Create a pull request on GitHub. If you're new to GitHub, read about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). You are welcome to submit your pull request for commentary or review before it is complete by creating a [draft pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests). Please include specific questions or items you'd like feedback on.
1. A member of the Daytona team will review your PR within three business days (excluding any holidays) and either merge, comment, and/or assign someone for review.
1. Work with the reviewer to complete a code review. For each change, create a new commit and push it to make changes to your pull request. When necessary, the reviewer can trigger CI to run tests prior to merging.
1. Once you believe your pull request is ready to be reviewed, ensure the pull request is no longer a draft by [marking it ready for review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request).
1. The reviewer will look over your contribution and either approve it or provide comments letting you know if there is anything left to do. We try to give you the opportunity to make the required changes yourself, but in some cases, we may perform the changes ourselves if it makes sense to (minor changes or for urgent issues). We do our best to review PRs promptly, but complex changes could require more time.
1. After completing your review, a Daytona team member will trigger merge to run all tests. Upon passing, your change will be merged into `main`, and your pull requests will be closed. All merges to `main` create a new release, and all final changes are attributed to you.

Note: In some cases, we might decide that a PR should be closed without merging. We'll make sure to provide clear reasoning when this happens.

### Adding Yourself to the Contributors List

When making a pull request to the System Initiative software, you must add yourself to the [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md) list.
You will only have to do this the first time that you contribute to the software.
For this, we recommend adding yourself with a separate commit (does not have to be a separate PR) to the file.

#### What Does this Mean for You?

Here is what being a contributor means for you:

* License all our contributions to the project under the Apache License, Version 2.0
* Have the legal rights to license our contributions ourselves, or get permission to license them from our employers, clients, or others who may have them

For more information, see the [README](README.md) and feel free to reach out to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/daytonacommunity/shared_invite/zt-273yohksh-Q5YSB5V7tnQzX2RoTARr7Q).

Now, let's walk through how to add yourself to the list.

#### (1) Editing the File

In [the file](CONTRIBUTING.md), there is a delimiter (e.g. `-----------`) followed by a list of names and associated GitHub usernames.
The format of the contributor lines are as follows:

```
* <name-you-would-like-to-be-referred-to-as> (@<github-username>)
```

Here is an example:

```
* Nick Gerace (@nickgerace)
```

You do not have to use your legal name. 
You can provide a name you would like to referred to as, a nickname, etc.
In fact, you can use your GitHub username in the "name" slot.
Here is an example:

```
* nickgerace (@nickgerace)
```

Your name can be of multiple words and use multiple whitespaces too.
Here's a totally real example:

```
* Todd Howard Skyrim McFallout-y Starfield Pants (@totallyrealusername)
```

Above all, ensure that the format described at the beginning is preserved.

#### (2) Polish Your Addition and Ensure the List is Ready

When making changes, ensure the following:

- Your individual line was appended to the bottom of the list
- No additional newlines were added
- Your individual line has no trailing or leading spaces
- Your individual line matches the aforementioned format
- Your GitHub username appears exactly once
- Nothing else in the contributors file changed

#### (3) Commit Your Change

We recommend adding yourself with a separate commit (does not have to be a separate PR) to the file with the following commit title format:

```
chore: add <github-username> to contributors
```

Here is an example:

```
chore: add nickgerace to contributors
```

After the commit is pushed, you should be good to go!
