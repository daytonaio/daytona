# Preparing Your Changes

This document contains information related to preparing changes for a pull request.

## Commit Message Format

We do not require a particular commit message format of any kind, but we do require that individual commits be descriptive, relative to size and impact.
For example, if a descriptive title covers what the commit does in practice, then an additional description below the title is not required.
However, if the commit has an out-sized impact relative to other commits, its description will need to reflect that.

Reviewers may ask you to amend your commits if they are not descriptive enough.
Since the descriptiveness of a commit is subjective, please feel free to talk to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/daytonacommunity/shared_invite/zt-273yohksh-Q5YSB5V7tnQzX2RoTARr7Q) if you have any questions.

### Optional Commit Template

If you would like an optional commit template, see the following:

```text
<present-tense-verb-with-capitalized-first-letter> <everything-else-without-puncutation-at-the-end>

<sentences-in-paragraph-format-or-bullet-points>
```
