## Why Daytona?
Daytona is a radically simple open source development environment manager.

Setting up development environments has become increasingly challenging over time, especially when aiming to set up remotely, where the complexity increases by a order of magnitude. The process is so complex that we've compiled a [comprehensive guide](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/diy-guide-to-transform-any-machine-into-a-codespace) detailing all the necessary steps to set one up—spanning __5,000 words__, __7 steps__, and requiring anywhere from 15 to __45 minutes__. 

This complexity is unnecessary.

With Daytona, you need only to execute a single command: `daytona create`.

Daytona automates the entire process; provisioning the instance, interpreting and applying the configuration, setting up prebuilds, establishing a secure VPN connection, securly connecting your local or a Web IDE, and assigning a fully qualified domain name to the development environment for easy sharing and collaboration. 

As a developer, you can immediately start focusing on what matters most—your code.



## Backstory
We spent most of our careers building cloud development environments. In 2009, we launched what was likely the first commercial [Cloud IDE](https://codeanywhere.com) project. At that time, technology was lacking, forcing us to develop everything from scratch—the IDE, the environment orchestrator, and almost everything else. A lot of people were interested, and over 2.5 million developers signed up! But we were too early, and we asked too much from our users to change how they worked.

Now, 15 years since its inception, we have noticed quite a few things. First, the technology we wished for back then exists now. Second, approximately 50% of developers work in remote dev environments, and third, and most importantly, setting up development environments has become more complex than ever, both locally and to a greater magnitude for remote.

So, we took everything we learned and decided to solve these issues once and for all as a fully open-source project. Our goal was to create a single binary that allows you to set up a development environment anywhere you wish, completely free, and finally fulfill the promise that many have attempted to make.

## Getting Started
### Requirements

Daytona itself has a tiny memory and cpu requirements and will run on any machine. It can create development environments (Workspaces) both locally or on remote targets.

Before you create a development environment using Daytona, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- __Hardware Resources__: Depending on the project requirements, ensure your machine has sufficient resources. Usually a minimum hardware specification is at least 1cpu, 2GB of RAM and 10GB of disk space. For optimal performance we advise to allocate more resources depending on the project complexity.

*Note. If using `docker-provider`

- __Docker__: Ensure Docker is installed and running on the target machine. Daytona `docker-provider` relies on Docker to create and manage development environments.

Please verify these requirements to ensure a smooth installation and operation of Daytona on your system.

### Installing Daytona
Daytona allows you to manage your Development Environments using the Daytona CLI. To install it, please execute the following command:

```bash
curl https://download.daytona.io/daytona/get-server.sh | bash
```

Alternatively, download and compile Daytona directly from this repository by consulting our [documentation](https://daytona.io/docs).

> [!NOTE]
> The packaged Daytona includes a set of built-in extensions located in the extensions folder, which are added there for your convince.

### Initializing Daytona
To initialize Daytona, follow these steps:

__1. Start the Daytona Service:__  
This initiates the Daytona service, which must always be running for Daytona to function. Use the command:
```bash
daytona server
```
__2. Add Your Git Provider of Choice:__  
Daytona supports GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. To add them to your profile, use the command:  
```bash
daytona git-providers add

```
Follow the steps provided. Here's a link to the [documentation](https://daytona.io/docs) for more details.

__3. Add Your Provider:__  
This step is for choosing where to deploy Development Environments. By default, Daytona includes a Docker provider to spin up environments on your local machine. For remote development environments, use the command:
```bash
daytona provider add
```
This command allows adding connections to an SSH machine or one of the cloud providers (Contributions welcome here!).

__4. Choose Your Default IDE:__  
The default setting for Daytona is VS Code locally. If you prefer, you can switch to VS Code - Browser or any IDE from the JetBrains portfolio (Contributions welcome here!) using the command:
```bash
daytona ide
```
Now that you have installed and initialized Daytona, you can proceed to setting up your development environments and start coding instantly.  


## Using Daytona


### Creating Dev Environments 
Creating development environments with Daytona is a straightforward process, accomplished with just one command:
```bash
daytona create
```
Upon executing this command, you will be prompted with two questions:
1. Choose the provider to decide where to create a dev environment.
2. Select or type the Git repository you wish to use to create a dev environment.

After making your selections, press enter, and Daytona will handle the rest. All that remains for you to do is to execute the following command to open your default IDE:
```bash
daytona code
```

This command opens your development environment in your preferred IDE, allowing you to start coding instantly.

### Manipulating Dev Environments  
To manage your development environments, Daytona provides several commands that facilitate various operations:  

__- Listing Dev Environments:__ 
To view a list of all your dev environments, use:
```bash
daytona list
```

__- Deleting a Dev Environment:__ 
To remove a specific development environment, execute:
```bash
daytona delete
```
This command deletes the specified development environment.

__- Displaying Dev Environment Information:__ 
or details about a specific workspace, including its status and configuration, use:
```bash
daytona info
```

__- Starting and Stopping Dev Environments:__   
- To start a Dev Environment, making it active and accessible, use:
```bash
daytona start
```
- To stop a Dev Environment, thereby deactivating it, use:
```bash
daytona stop
```

__- Managing Port Forwarding:__ 
If you need to manage the ports forwarded to your project, facilitating access to services running in your development environment, use:
```bash
daytona ports
```

__- SSH Access:__ 
For direct SSH access to a development environment using the terminal, execute:
```bash
daytona ssh
```
This allows for a secure command-line interface with your dev environment.

### Other Commands
In addition to the creation and management of dev environments, Daytona provides several commands for customization and accessing information:

__- Managing Profiles:__ 
Daytona allows for the management of multiple profiles, enabling users to switch between personal use and connecting to a company's installation of the Daytona platform. To manage profiles, use the following command:
```bash
daytona profile
```

__- View Version:__ 
To find out the version of Daytona you are using, the following command can be used to print the version number:
```bash
daytona version
```

For more detailed information about each command, please refer to Daytona's [documentation](https://daytona.io/docs).







  

## Architecture 
TODO: desc

## How to Extend Daytona

Daytona offers flexibility for extension through the creation of plugins and providers.


### Providers 
Daytona is designed to be infrastructure-agnostic, capable of creating and managing development environments across various platforms. Providers are the components that encapsulate the logic for provisioning compute resources on a specific target platform. They allow for the configuration of different targets within a single provider, enabling, for instance, multiple AWS profiles within an AWS provider.

How does it work? When executing the `daytona create` command, Daytona communicates the environment details to the selected provider, which then provisions the necessary compute resources. Once provisioned, Daytona sets up the environment on these resources, allowing the user to interact with the environment seamlessly.

Prroviders are independent projects that adhere to the Daytona Provider interface. They can be developed in nearly any major programming language. For more details, see [Providers](providers/readme.md)


### Plugins
Plugins enhance Daytona's core functionalities by adding new CLI commands, API methods, or services within the development environments. They offer configurable settings to tailor the plugin's behavior to the user's needs.

Similar to providers, plugins are independent projects that conform to the Daytona Plugin interface and can be developed in a wide range of programming languages. For more information, visit  [Plugins](plugins/readme.md)
