----
Daytona is a radically simple open source development environment standard. It automates the entire process; provisioning the instance, reading the configuration and executing it, setting up prebuilds, attaching your local or a Web IDE, and adding a fully qualified domain name to the dev environment to share and collaborate.

Daytona builds upon a decade and a half of experience of the team responsible for pioneering the Cloud IDE movement. This expertise encompasses the development of IDEs and orchestrators from scratch, facilitating the provision of instant cloud development environments. By integrating modern technologies and advancements with this historical knowledge,  Daytona is committed to eradicating the "works on my machine" syndrome once and for all.

More information on the [Daytona](https://daytona.io/) website.

## Getting Started


### Installing Daytona
Daytona allows you to manage your Development Environments using the Daytona CLI. To install it, please execute the following command:

```bash
curl https://download.daytona.io/daytona/get-server.sh | bash
```

You can also download and compile Daytona from this repository. To do so please check out our docs.

Note the packaged Daytona includes a set of built-in extensions located in the extensions folder, which are added there for your convince.

### Initializing Daytona
To initialize Daytona, follow these steps:

__1. Start the Daytona Service:__  
This initiates the Daytona service, which must always be running for Daytona to function. Use the command:
```bash
daytona server
```
__2. Add Your Git Provider of Choice:__  
Daytona supports GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. To add them to your profile, use the command:  
```bash
daytona git-providers add

```
Follow the steps provided. Here's a link to the [documentation](https://daytona.io/docs) for more details.

__3. Add Your Provider:__  
This step is for choosing where to deploy Development Environments. By default, Daytona includes a Docker provider to spin up environments on your local machine. For remote development environments, use the command:
```bash
daytona providers add
```
This command allows adding connections to an SSH machine or one of the cloud providers (Contributions welcome here!).

__4. Choose Your Default IDE:__  
The default setting for Daytona is VS Code locally. If you prefer, you can switch to VS Code - Browser or any IDE from the JetBrains portfolio (Contributions welcome here!) using the command:
```bash
daytona ide
```





### Setting up your first Daytona Dev environment
```bash
daytona agent install
```

input ssh name (can be localhost)

input username/ password

Note you can use  aws provisioner to auto proivision a vm for each Daytona dev en
