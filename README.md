## Why Daytona?
Daytona is a radically simple open source development environment manager.

Setting up development environments has become increasingly challenging over time, especially when aiming to set up remotely, where the complexity increases by an order of magnitude. The process is so complex that we've compiled a [comprehensive guide](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/diy-guide-to-transform-any-machine-into-a-codespace) detailing all the necessary steps to set one up—spanning __5,000 words__, __7 steps__, and requiring anywhere from 15 to __45 minutes__.

This complexity is unnecessary.

With Daytona, you need only to execute a single command: `daytona create`.

Daytona automates the entire process; provisioning the instance, interpreting and applying the configuration, setting up prebuilds, establishing a secure VPN connection, securely connecting your local or a Web IDE, and assigning a fully qualified domain name to the development environment for easy sharing and collaboration.

As a developer, you can immediately start focusing on what matters most—your code.



## Backstory
We spent most of our careers building cloud development environments. In 2009, we launched what was likely the first commercial [Cloud IDE](https://codeanywhere.com) project. At that time, technology was lacking, forcing us to develop everything from scratch—the IDE, the environment orchestrator, and almost everything else. A lot of people were interested, and over 2.5 million developers signed up! But we were too early, and we asked too much from our users to change how they worked.

Now, 15 years since its inception, we have noticed quite a few things. First, the technology we wished for back then exists now. Second, approximately 50% of developers work in remote dev environments, and third, and most importantly, setting up development environments has become more complex than ever, both locally and to a greater magnitude for remote.

So, we took everything we learned and decided to solve these issues once and for all as a fully open-source project. Our goal was to create a single binary that allows you to set up a development environment anywhere you wish, completely free, and finally fulfill the promise that many have attempted to make.






## Getting Started
### Requirements
Before starting the installation script, please go over all the necessary requirements:
- __Hardware Resources__: Depending on the project requirements, ensure your machine has sufficient resources. Minimum hardware specification is 1cpu, 2GB of RAM and 10GB of disk space.
- __Docker__: Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed and running.



### Installing Daytona
Daytona allows you to manage your Development Environments using the Daytona CLI. To install it, please execute the following command:

```bash
# Install Daytona into /usr/local/bin
curl -sf -L https://download.daytona.io/daytona/install.sh | sudo bash

# OR if you want to install Daytona to some other path where you don`t need sudo
# curl -sf -L https://download.daytona.io/daytona/install.sh | DAYTONA_PATH=/home/user/bin bash
```
<details open>
  <summary> Manual installation </summary>
  If you don't want to use the provided script, download the binary directly from the URL for your specific OS:

  ```bash
  curl -sf -L https://download.daytona.io/daytona/latest/daytona-darwin-amd64 -o daytona
  curl -sf -L https://download.daytona.io/daytona/latest/daytona-darwin-arm64 -o daytona

  ```
  Make sure that path where `daytona` binary is downloaded is in your system PATH.
</details>



### Initializing Daytona
To initialize Daytona, follow these steps:

__1. Start the Daytona Server:__
This initiates the Daytona Server in daemon mode. Use the command:
```bash
daytona server
```
__2. Add Your Git Provider of Choice:__
Daytona supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server, Gitea, Gitness, AWS CodeCommit, Azure DevOps and Gogs. To add them to your profile, use the command:
```bash
daytona git-providers add

```
Follow the steps provided.

__3. Add Your Provider Target:__
This step is for choosing where to deploy Development Environments. By default, Daytona includes a Docker provider to spin up environments on your local machine. For remote development environments, use the command:
```bash
daytona target set
```
Following the steps this command adds SSH machines to your targets.

__4. Choose Your Default IDE:__
The default setting for Daytona is VS Code locally. If you prefer, you can switch to VS Code - Browser or any IDE from the JetBrains portfolio using the command:
```bash
daytona ide
```
Now that you have installed and initialized Daytona, you can proceed to setting up your development environments and start coding instantly.





### Creating Dev Environments
Creating development environments with Daytona is a straightforward process, accomplished with just one command:
```bash
daytona create
```

You can add the `--no-ide` flag if you don't wish to open the IDE immediately after creating the environment.

Upon executing this command, you will be prompted with two questions:
1. Choose the provider to decide where to create a dev environment.
2. Select or type the Git repository you wish to use to create a dev environment.

After making your selections, press enter, and Daytona will handle the rest. All that remains for you to do is to execute the following command to open your default IDE:
```bash
daytona code
```

This command opens your development environment in your preferred IDE, allowing you to start coding instantly.

### Stopping the Daytona Server:
```bash
daytona server stop
```

### Restarting the Daytona Server:
```bash
daytona server restart
```

## How to Extend Daytona

Daytona offers flexibility for extension through the creation of plugins and providers.


### Providers
Daytona is designed to be infrastructure-agnostic, capable of creating and managing development environments across various platforms. Providers are the components that encapsulate the logic for provisioning compute resources on a specific target platform. They allow for the configuration of different targets within a single provider, enabling, for instance, multiple AWS profiles within an AWS provider.

How does it work? When executing the `daytona create` command, Daytona communicates the environment details to the selected provider, which then provisions the necessary compute resources. Once provisioned, Daytona sets up the environment on these resources, allowing the user to interact with the environment seamlessly.

Providers are independent projects that adhere to the Daytona Provider interface. They can be developed in nearly any major programming language. More details coming soon.


### Plugins
Plugins enhance Daytona's core functionalities by adding new CLI commands, API methods, or services within the development environments. They offer configurable settings to tailor the plugin's behavior to the user's needs.

Similar to providers, plugins are independent projects that conform to the Daytona Plugin interface and can be developed in a wide range of programming languages. More details coming soon.

    ```bash
    daytona git-provider add
    ```

1. **Create a Workspace with Daytona**

    Use the Daytona CLI to create a workspace for your forked repository. Replace YOUR-FORK-URL with the URL of your forked repository.
    ```bash
    daytona create YOUR-FORK-URL
    ```
1.  **Create a new branch**
    
    Once in the development container, create a new branch for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-new-feature
    ```

1. **Running Daytona in development mode**
    A `dtn` alias is automatically created inside the Workspace. You can use it to compile and run daytona.
    For example:
    ```bash
    dtn serve
    ```

1. **Make changes to the project**

    Prepare your changes and ensure your commits are descriptive. The document contains an optional commit template, if desired.

1. **Test your changes**

    Ensure to test your changes by running the project locally. 
    Run the following command in the daytona root directory to run the tests:
    
    ```bash
    go test ./...
    ```

1. **Generate docs**

    Ensure to generate new docs after making command related changes, by running ./hack/generate-cli-docs.sh in the daytona root directory.

    ```bash
    ./hack/generate-cli-docs.sh
    ```

1. **Generate new API client**

    ```

1. **Sign off on your commits**

    Ensure that you sign off on all your commits to comply with the DCO v1.1. We have more details in [Prepare your changes](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/blob/main/PREPARING_YOUR_CHANGES.md).

    To sign off on your Git commits more easily, you can use the -s or --signoff option when making a commit. This adds a "Signed-off-by" line to your commit message automatically, which is required to comply with the DCO v1.1.

    Here's how you can do it:

    ```bash
    git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
    ```
    This command adds the necessary sign-off to your commit without needing to rebase later.

    If you've already made commits without the sign-off, you can add it retrospectively by rebasing:

    ```bash
    git rebase HEAD~1 --signoff
    git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
    ```
