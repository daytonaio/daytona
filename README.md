![Daytona Core](./public/images/daytona.png)

Daytona Core offers individual developers advantages over other solutions for managing development environments. With Daytona Core, you have an easy and open source solution in a single binary. No Kubernetes clusters to setup and manage. No SaaS accounts or limited free hours to work with.

There are two ways to use Daytona Core. If you have got Docker installed (Docker Desktop or Docker Engine) you can use Daytona Core locally to manage your development environments. This is similar to the experience you get from using the dev container CLI. Except that with Daytona Core, you do not have to specify a dev container file. You can use plain git repositories with any container image.

The second way is to use Daytona Core to manage remote development environments. The only requirement is SSH access to a host that can run Docker. If you have a home lab, Linux VM, or access to a developer friendly cloud like Digital Ocean, Civo, Scaleway, etc this is a great option.

## Features

# Usage

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Using Daytona Core is straightforward. Youâ€™ll need a Linux host running Docker. This can be local or remote. Here are the commands you will need to get started:

To setup the Daytona:

Start the server with

```
daytona server
```

In a separate shell or on a different machine you can add a profile for that server.

```
daytona profile add
```

![Create Profile](./public/images/create-profile.png)

To create a new remote development environment, use:

```
daytona create <name> -r <https://github.com/repo/youwant>
```
![Create Workspace](./public/images/create-workspace.png)

You can list the running workspaces with:

```
daytona list
```
![List Workspaces](./public/images/list-workspace.png)

You can open the workspace in VS Code with:

```
daytona open <name>
```

Or you can SSH to the workspace with:

```
daytona ssh <name>
```
