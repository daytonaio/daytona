----
Daytona is a radically simple open source development environment standard. It automates the entire process; provisioning the instance (if remote), to reading the config and executing it, setting up prebuilds, attaching a local ide, to adding a fully qualified domain name to the dev environment to share and collaborate.

Daytona builds upon a decade and a half of experience of the team responsible for pioneering the Cloud IDE movement, the project Codeanywhere. Using the learning of building IDEs and orchestraters from scratch to be able to provision instant development environments,  incorporating that with technologies that are now available, and building oin the dream tha code works on any maching you run it one the team set out to make that instant dev environments a possibility to all 

In essence Daytona removes all the complexities of setting up dev environments and lets you focus on code. 
More information on the Daytona website.

## Design Principles
* __Single Command__: Activate a fully configured development environment with a single command, eliminating the need for any further user interaction.
* __Host agnostic__: Provision where possible; otherwise, seamlessly connect to existing hosts while abstracting all complexities.
* __Interoperability__: Compatibility with all existing technologies development environment technologies
* __Accessibility__: Enable development environments to be accessible behind firewalls, ensuring utilization and collaboration regardless of network restrictions.
* __Extensibility__: Enable extensibility with plugin development. Moreover, in any dynamic language, not just Go.
* __Works on my Machine__: Never experince it again.

## Getting Started


### Install CLI
To manage Daytona Dev environments you need to have access to the Daytona CLI, you can do this by using brew:

```brew daytona install```

You can also download and compile Daytona from this repository. To do so please check out our docs.

Note the packaged Daytona includes a set of built-in extensions located in the extensions folder, which are added there for your convince.

### Setting up your first Daytona Dev environment
```daytona agent install```

input ssh name (can be localhost)

input username/ password

Note you can use  aws provisioner to auto proivision a vm for each Daytona dev en


## Features


* __Runs everywhere__: Spin up your development environment on any machineâ€”whether it's local, remote, a physical server, VM, or cloud-based.

* __Confiuration File Support__: Initially support for [dev container](https://containers.dev/), ability to expand to DevFile, Nix & Backstage (Contributions welcome here!).
* __Prebuilds System__: Has a prebuilds system, built in, to drasticly improve environment setup times.
* __IDE Support__ : Seamlessly supports [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) & [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/) locally, ready to use without configuration. Includes a built-in Web IDE for added convenience.
* __Git Provider Integration__: Start with GitHub support, allowing easy repo or PR selection via dropdown. Future plans to expand to GitLab & Bitbucket (Contributions welcome here!).
* __Reverse Proxy Integration__: Enable collaboration and streamline feedback loops by leveraging reverse proxy functionality. Access preview environments and the Web IDE seamlessly, even behind firewalls.
* Spin-up ready to code development environments (Workspaces) for all popular programming languages
* Multiple repository Workspace configuration suitable for micro-service architecture
* First class devcontainer.json support
* Easy install on remote machines over SSH
* Prebuild hooks for always ready to code environments
* Plugin system for extending the core feature set
* Available plugins for SSH access, VS Code Server, Tailscale
