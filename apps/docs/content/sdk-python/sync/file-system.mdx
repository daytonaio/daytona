## FileSystem

```python
class FileSystem()
```

Provides file system operations within a Sandbox.

This class implements a high-level interface to file system operations that can
be performed within a Daytona Sandbox.

**Attributes**:

- `instance` _SandboxInstance_ - The Sandbox instance this file system belongs to.

#### FileSystem.\_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(instance: SandboxInstance, toolbox_api: ToolboxApi,
             get_root_dir: Callable[[], str])
```

Initializes a new FileSystem instance.

**Arguments**:

- `instance` _SandboxInstance_ - The Sandbox instance this file system belongs to.
- `toolbox_api` _ToolboxApi_ - API client for Sandbox operations.
- `get_root_dir` _Callable[[], str]_ - A function to get the default root directory of the Sandbox.

#### FileSystem.create_folder

```python
@intercept_errors(message_prefix="Failed to create folder: ")
def create_folder(path: str, mode: str) -> None
```

Creates a new directory in the Sandbox at the specified path with the given
permissions.

**Arguments**:

- `path` _str_ - Path where the folder should be created. Relative paths are resolved based
  on the user's root directory.
- `mode` _str_ - Folder permissions in octal format (e.g., "755" for rwxr-xr-x).

**Example**:

```python
# Create a directory with standard permissions
sandbox.fs.create_folder("workspace/data", "755")

# Create a private directory
sandbox.fs.create_folder("workspace/secrets", "700")
```

#### FileSystem.delete_file

```python
@intercept_errors(message_prefix="Failed to delete file: ")
def delete_file(path: str) -> None
```

Deletes a file from the Sandbox.

**Arguments**:

- `path` _str_ - Absolute path to the file to delete.

**Example**:

```python
# Delete a file
sandbox.fs.delete_file("workspace/data/old_file.txt")
```

#### FileSystem.download_file

```python
@overload
def download_file(remote_path: str, timeout: int = 30 * 60) -> bytes
```

Downloads a file from the Sandbox. Returns the file contents as a bytes object.
This method is useful when you want to load the file into memory without saving it to disk.
It can only be used for smaller files.

**Arguments**:

- `remote_path` _str_ - Path to the file in the Sandbox. Relative paths are resolved based on the user's
  root directory.
- `timeout` _int_ - Timeout for the download operation in seconds. 0 means no timeout. Default is 30 minutes.

**Returns**:

- `bytes` - The file contents as a bytes object.

**Example**:

```python
# Download and save a file locally
content = sandbox.fs.download_file("workspace/data/file.txt")
with open("local_copy.txt", "wb") as f:
    f.write(content)

# Download and process text content
content = sandbox.fs.download_file("workspace/data/config.json")
config = json.loads(content.decode('utf-8'))
```

#### FileSystem.download_file

```python
@overload
def download_file(remote_path: str,
                  local_path: str,
                  timeout: int = 30 * 60) -> None
```

Downloads a file from the Sandbox and saves it to a local file using stream.
This method is useful when you want to download larger files that may not fit into memory.

**Arguments**:

- `remote_path` _str_ - Path to the file in the Sandbox. Relative paths are resolved based on the user's
  root directory.
- `local_path` _str_ - Path to save the file locally.
- `timeout` _int_ - Timeout for the download operation in seconds. 0 means no timeout. Default is 30 minutes.

**Example**:

```python
local_path = "local_copy.txt"
sandbox.fs.download_file("tmp/large_file.txt", local_path)
size_mb = os.path.getsize(local_path) / 1024 / 1024
print(f"Size of the downloaded file {local_path}: {size_mb} MB")
```

#### FileSystem.find_files

```python
@intercept_errors(message_prefix="Failed to find files: ")
def find_files(path: str, pattern: str) -> List[Match]
```

Searches for files containing a pattern, similar to
the grep command.

**Arguments**:

- `path` _str_ - Path to the file or directory to search. If the path is a directory,
  the search will be performed recursively. Relative paths are resolved based on the user's
  root directory.

matches = sandbox.fs.find_files("workspace/src", "TODO:")
for match in matches:
    print(f"{match.file}:{match.line}: {match.content.strip()}")
```

#### FileSystem.get_file_info

```python

                timeout: int = 30 * 60) -> None
```

Uploads a file from the local file system to the specified path in the Sandbox.
If a file already exists at the destination path, it will be overwritten. This method uses
streaming to upload the file, so it is useful when you want to upload larger files that may
not fit into memory.

**Arguments**:

- `local_path` _str_ - Path to the local file to upload.
- `remote_path` _str_ - Path to the destination file in the Sandbox. Relative paths are
  resolved based on the user's root directory.

**Example**:

```python
sandbox.fs.upload_file("local_file.txt", "tmp/large_file.txt")
```

#### FileSystem.upload_files

```python
@intercept_errors(message_prefix="Failed to upload files: ")
def upload_files(files: List[FileUpload], timeout: int = 30 * 60) -> None
```

Uploads multiple files to the Sandbox. If files already exist at the destination paths,
they will be overwritten.

**Arguments**:

- `files` _List[FileUpload]_ - List of files to upload.
- `timeout` _int_ - Timeout for the upload operation in seconds. 0 means no timeout. Default is 30 minutes.

**Example**:

```python
# Upload multiple text files
files = [
    FileUpload(
        source=b"Content of file 1",
        destination="/tmp/file1.txt"
    ),
    FileUpload(
        source="workspace/data/file2.txt",
        destination="/tmp/file2.txt"
    ),
    FileUpload(
        source=b'{"key": "value"}',
        destination="/tmp/config.json"
    )
]
sandbox.fs.upload_files(files)
```

## FileUpload

```python
@dataclass
class FileUpload()
```

Represents a file to be uploaded to the Sandbox.

**Attributes**:

- `source` _Union[bytes, str]_ - File contents as a bytes object or a local file path. If a bytes object is provided,
  make sure it fits into memory, otherwise use the local file path which content will be streamed to the Sandbox.
- `destination` _str_ - Absolute destination path in the Sandbox. Relative paths are resolved based on the user's
  root directory.
