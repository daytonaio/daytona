## LspServer

Provides Language Server Protocol functionality for code intelligence to provide
IDE-like features such as code completion, symbol search, and more.

### Constructors

#### new LspServer()

```ts
new LspServer(
   languageId: LspLanguageId,
   pathToProject: string,
   toolboxApi: ToolboxApi,
   instance: SandboxInstance): LspServer
```

**Parameters**:

- `languageId` _LspLanguageId_
- `pathToProject` _string_
- `toolboxApi` _ToolboxApi_
- `instance` _SandboxInstance_

**Returns**:

- `LspServer`

### Methods

#### completions()

```ts
completions(path: string, position: Position): Promise<CompletionList>
```

Gets completion suggestions at a position in a file.

**Parameters**:

- `path` _string_ - Path to the file. Relative paths are resolved based on the project path
  set in the LSP server constructor.
- `position` _Position_ - The position in the file where completion was requested

**Returns**:

- `Promise<CompletionList>` - List of completion suggestions. The list includes:
  - isIncomplete: Whether more items might be available
  - items: List of completion items, each containing:
  - label: The text to insert
  - kind: The kind of completion
  - detail: Additional details about the item
  - documentation: Documentation for the item
  - sortText: Text used to sort the item in the list
  - filterText: Text used to filter the item
  - insertText: The actual text to insert (if different from label)

**Example:**

```ts
// Get completions at a specific position
const completions = await lsp.completions('workspace/project/src/index.ts', {
  line: 10,
  character: 15,
})
completions.items.forEach((item) => {
  console.log(`${item.label} (${item.kind}): ${item.detail}`)
})
```

#### didClose()

```ts
didClose(path: string): Promise<void>
```

Notifies the language server that a file has been closed, should be called when a file is closed
in the editor to allow the language server to clean up any resources associated with that file.

**Parameters**:

- `path` _string_ - Path to the closed file. Relative paths are resolved based on the project path
  set in the LSP server constructor.

**Returns**:

- `Promise<void>`

**Example:**

```ts
// When done editing a file
await lsp.didClose('workspace/project/src/index.ts')
```

---

#### didOpen()

```ts
didOpen(path: string): Promise<void>
```

Notifies the language server that a file has been opened, enabling
language features like diagnostics and completions for that file. The server
will begin tracking the file's contents and providing language features.

**Parameters**:

- `path` _string_ - Path to the opened file. Relative paths are resolved based on the user's
  root directory.

**Returns**:

- `Promise<void>`

**Example:**

```ts
// When opening a file for editing
await lsp.didOpen('workspace/project/src/index.ts')
// Now can get completions, symbols, etc. for this file
```

---

#### documentSymbols()

```ts
documentSymbols(path: string): Promise<LspSymbol[]>
```

Get symbol information (functions, classes, variables, etc.) from a document.

**Parameters**:

- `path` _string_ - Path to the file to get symbols from. Relative paths are resolved based on the project path
  set in the LSP server constructor.

**Returns**:

- `Promise<LspSymbol[]>` - List of symbols in the document. Each symbol includes:
  - name: The symbol's name
  - kind: The symbol's kind (function, class, variable, etc.)
  - location: The location of the symbol in the file

**Example:**

```ts
// Get all symbols in a file
const symbols = await lsp.documentSymbols('workspace/project/src/index.ts')
symbols.forEach((symbol) => {
  console.log(`${symbol.kind} ${symbol.name}: ${symbol.location}`)
})
```

---

#### sandboxSymbols()

```ts
sandboxSymbols(query: string): Promise<LspSymbol[]>
```

Searches for symbols matching the query string across the entire Sandbox.

**Parameters**:

- `query` _string_ - Search query to match against symbol names

**Returns**:

- `Promise<LspSymbol[]>` - List of matching symbols from all files. Each symbol includes:
  - name: The symbol's name
  - kind: The symbol's kind (function, class, variable, etc.)
  - location: The location of the symbol in the file

**Example:**

```ts
// Search for all symbols containing "User"
const symbols = await lsp.sandboxSymbols('User')
symbols.forEach((symbol) => {
  console.log(`${symbol.name} (${symbol.kind}) in ${symbol.location}`)
})
```

---

#### start()

```ts
start(): Promise<void>
```

Starts the language server, must be called before using any other LSP functionality.
It initializes the language server for the specified language and project.

**Returns**:

- `Promise<void>`

**Example:**

```ts
const lsp = await sandbox.createLspServer('typescript', 'workspace/project')
await lsp.start() // Initialize the server
// Now ready for LSP operations
```

---

#### stop()

```ts
stop(): Promise<void>
```

Stops the language server, should be called when the LSP server is no longer needed to
free up system resources.

**Returns**:

- `Promise<void>`

**Example:**

```ts
// When done with LSP features
await lsp.stop() // Clean up resources
```

---

#### ~~workspaceSymbols()~~

```ts
workspaceSymbols(query: string): Promise<LspSymbol[]>
```

Searches for symbols matching the query string across the entire Sandbox.

**Parameters**:

- `query` _string_ - Search query to match against symbol names

**Returns**:

- `Promise<LspSymbol[]>` - List of matching symbols from all files. Each symbol includes:
  - name: The symbol's name
  - kind: The symbol's kind (function, class, variable, etc.)
  - location: The location of the symbol in the file

##### Deprecated

Use `sandboxSymbols` instead. This method will be removed in a future version.

## LspLanguageId

Supported language server types.

**Enum Members**:

- `JAVASCRIPT` ("javascript")
- `PYTHON` ("python")
- `TYPESCRIPT` ("typescript")

## Position

Represents a zero-based position within a text document,
specified by line number and character offset.

**Properties**:

- `character` _number_ - Zero-based character offset on the line
- `line` _number_ - Zero-based line number in the document

**Example:**

```ts
const position: Position = {
  line: 10, // Line 11 (zero-based)
  character: 15, // Character 16 on the line (zero-based)
}
```
