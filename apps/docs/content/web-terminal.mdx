Daytona provides a Web Terminal for interacting with your Sandboxes, allowing for a convenient way to view files, run commands, and debug.

You can open it by clicking on the Terminal icon `>_` in the [Sandbox list](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/sandboxes) under Access for any running Sandbox. It is available by default and is accessible on port `22222`.

:::note
Since Terminal access is a very sensitive procedure, it is accessible only to users in your Organization, even when setting the `public` parameter to `True` in `CreateSandboxFromSnapshotParams` or `CreateSandboxFromImageParams`.
