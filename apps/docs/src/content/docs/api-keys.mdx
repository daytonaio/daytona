Daytona API keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Daytona API](/docs/tools/api).

The [Configuration](/docs/configuration) page explains how to set the `DAYTONA_API_KEY` environment variable.

To manage your API keys, go to the [Keys](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys) section in the Dashboard. Click `Create Key` to generate a new key and copy it to your clipboard.

## Permissions

When adding a new API Key you will be prompted to select a set of permissions for the key:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **`Sandboxes`** | Grants the ability to create and manage Sandboxes |
| **`Snapshots`** | Grants the ability to create and manage Snapshots |
| **`Registries`** | Grants the ability to create and manage Registries |
| **`Volumes`** | Grants the ability to create and manage Volumes |

Each permission includes fine-grained scopes:  

- `write:*` for creating and updating  
- `delete:*` for deleting resources  

Example: `write:sandboxes`, `delete:sandboxes`
