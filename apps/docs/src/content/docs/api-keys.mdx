Daytona API keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Daytona API](/docs/tools/api).

The [Configuration](/docs/configuration) page covers how to set up your environment variables, including the `DAYTONA_API_KEY` environment variable.

To list existing API Keys go to the Keys subpage in the Dashboard. Clicking on `Create Key` will show a modal for creating and copying a new key to your clipboard.

## Expiration

When creating a new API Key you can optionally set an expiration date for the key. If no expiration date is set, the key will never expire.

## Permissions

When adding a new API Key you will be prompted to select a set of permissions for the key:

| Permission       | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Sandboxes`**  | Grants the ability to create and manage Sandboxes  |
| **`Snapshots`**  | Grants the ability to create and manage Snapshots  |
| **`Registries`** | Grants the ability to create and manage Registries |

Each of these permissions have scopes for creating and updating resources (e.g. `write:sandboxes`) and delete resources (e.g. `delete:sandboxes`) that can be separately granted.
