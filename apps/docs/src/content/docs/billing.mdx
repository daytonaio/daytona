The Billing subpage in the Dashboard shows billing information for Organizations.

## Wallet

The Wallet section shows the balance of the Organization's wallet and the amount of credits spent this month.

## Automatic Top-Up

Organizations can set automatic top-up rules for their wallets.

- **Threshold** — When the wallet balance drops to this amount, a top-up is triggered.  
- **Target** — The wallet balance is topped up to this amount.

Set both **Threshold** and **Target** to `0` to disable automatic top-up.

## Cost Breakdown

The **Cost Breakdown** chart displays cost usage by resource.

You can view usage for CPU, RAM, and Storage, and toggle between area and bar charts.
