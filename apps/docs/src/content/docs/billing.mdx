## Wallet

The Wallet section shows the balance of the Organization's wallet and the amount of credits spent this month.

## Automatic Top-Up

The Automatic Top-Up section allows organizations to set automatic top-up rules for their wallets.

The Threshold parameter sets the amount of credits that will trigger a top-up.

The Target parameter sets the amount of credits that will be available in the wallet after the top-up.

Setting Threshold and Target to 0 will disable the automatic top-up.
