title: API Keys

Daytona API keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Daytona API](/docs/en/tools/api). You can view, create, or delete your API Keys on the [API Keys](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys) page.

## Creating an API key

You can obtain an API key from the Daytona platform:

1. Navigate to [API Keys](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys), on the [Daytona Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/).
2. Click the **`Create Key`** button.
3. In the open modal, create and copy a new key to your clipboard.

To use an API key in your application, set the `DAYTONA_API_KEY` environment variable as described on the [Configuration](/docs/en/configuration) page.

## Permissions & Scopes

When creating a new API Key, you can select the specific permissions (scopes) it should have. Scopes control what actions the key can perform. Grant only the scopes you need for each key.

Below is a list of available scopes and their descriptions:
