Daytona API keys are used to authenticate requests to the [Daytona API](/docs/en/tools/api).

The [Configuration](/docs/en/configuration) page explains how to set the `DAYTONA_API_KEY` environment variable.

To manage your API keys, go to the [Keys](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys) section in the Dashboard. Click `Create Key` to generate a new key and copy it to your clipboard.

## Permissions
