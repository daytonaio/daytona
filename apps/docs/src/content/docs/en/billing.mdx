The [Billing](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/billing) page in the Daytona Dashboard provides an overview of your Organization's billing, wallet, and usage details.

## Wallet Overview

The Wallet section shows the balance of the Organization's wallet and the amount of credits spent this month.

## Automatic Top-Up

Organizations can set automatic top-up rules for their wallets.

- **Threshold** — When the wallet balance drops to this amount, a top-up is triggered.  
- **Target** — The wallet balance is topped up to this amount.

Set both **Threshold** and **Target** to `0` to disable automatic top-up.

## Cost Breakdown

The Cost Breakdown chart shows a breakdown of costs per resource. Users can view consumption for CPU, RAM and Disk and toggle between area and bar charts.
