[Daytona Billing ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/billing/spending) provides an overview of your organization's billing, wallet, and usage details.

Daytona displays a cost breakdown chart that shows a breakdown of costs per resource. You can choose between area and bar charts and filter by RAM, CPU, and storage. You can also filter by date range (last 12, 6, or 3 months).

## Wallet

[Daytona Wallet ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/billing/wallet) shows the current balance of the organization's wallet and the amount of credits spent this month.

### Add payment method

Daytona provides a payment method to add to your wallet. You can connect your credit card to your wallet to top up your balance.

1. Navigate to [Daytona Wallet ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/billing/wallet)
2. Click the **Connect** button next to the **Payment method** section
3. Follow the prompts to connect your credit card to your wallet.

Organizations can set automatic top-up rules for their wallets.

- **Threshold** — When the wallet balance drops to this amount, a top-up is triggered.

Set both **Threshold** and **Target** to `0` to disable automatic top-up.
