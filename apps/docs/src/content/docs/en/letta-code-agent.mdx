This guide demonstrates how to run an autonomous coding agent based on [Letta Code](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/) inside a Daytona sandbox environment. The agent can develop web apps, write code in any language, install dependencies, and run scripts. Letta Code uses stateful agents with built-in memory, allowing conversations to persist across sessions.

---

### 1. Workflow Overview

When you launch the main script, a Daytona sandbox is created and Letta Code is installed inside it. The agent is configured with a custom Daytona-aware system prompt.

The script provides an interactive CLI interface where you can chat with the agent and issue commands:

```
$ npm run start
Creating sandbox...
Installing Letta Code...
Starting Letta Code...
Initializing agent...
Agent initialized. Press Ctrl+C at any time to exit.

🔧 TodoWrite

🔧 TodoWrite
Perfect! I've created a beautiful markdown editor with live preview for you! 🎉

## Access your app here:
https://8080-c157e5cb-5e11-4bb6-883d-c873169223b8.proxy.daytona.works

## Features:

✨ **Live Preview** — Real-time markdown rendering  

📝 **Full Markdown Support** — Headers, text styles, lists, code blocks, tables, links, images  

💾 **Auto-Save** — Persists to browser localStorage  

📥 **Export** — Download as `.md` or standalone `.html`
```

The agent can host web apps and provide you with a preview link using the [Daytona Preview Links](https://www.daytona.io/docs/en/preview-and-authentication/) feature. When your task involves running or previewing a web application, the agent automatically hosts the app and generates a link for you to inspect the live result:

<Image
  src={lettaCodeAgentResult}
  alt="Markdown editor demo generated by Letta Code agent"
  width={600}
  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;"
/>

You can continue interacting with your agent until you are finished. When you exit the program, the sandbox will be deleted automatically.

### 2. Project Setup

#### Clone the Repository

First, clone the daytona [repository](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona.git) and navigate to the example directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona.git
cd daytona/guides/typescript/letta-code
```

#### Configure Environment

Get your Daytona API key from the [Daytona Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys) and your Letta API key from [Letta Platform](https://app.letta.com/api-keys).

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your keys:

```bash
DAYTONA_API_KEY=your_daytona_key
SANDBOX_LETTA_API_KEY=your_letta_api_key
```

:::caution[API Key Security]
In this example, your Letta API key is passed into the sandbox environment and may be accessible to any code executed within it.
:::

#### Local Usage

:::note[Node.js Version]
Node.js 18 or newer is required to run this example. Please ensure your environment meets this requirement before proceeding.
:::

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the example:

```bash
npm run start
```

The Letta Code agent will initialize and present an interactive prompt where you can issue commands.

### 3. Understanding the Agent's Architecture

This example consists of two main TypeScript files:

- **index.ts**: The main program that creates the Daytona sandbox, installs Letta Code, configures the system prompt, and provides an interactive CLI interface.
- **letta-session.ts**: A helper class that manages PTY-based bidirectional communication with Letta Code, handling JSON message streaming and response parsing.

#### Initialization

On initialization, the main program:
1. Creates a new [Daytona sandbox](/docs/en/sandboxes) with your Letta API key included in the environment variables.
2. Installs Letta Code globally inside the sandbox by running `npm install` with [process execution](/docs/en/process-code-execution#process-execution).
3. Creates a [PTY (pseudoterminal)](/docs/en/pty/) session in the sandbox for bidirectional communication with Letta Code.
4. Launches Letta Code in [bidirectional headless mode](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/headless/) with stream-json format through the PTY.
5. Waits for user input and sends prompts to the agent through the PTY session.

#### Main Program Code

The program creates a [Daytona sandbox](/docs/en/sandboxes) with the Letta API key passed as an environment variable:

```typescript
sandbox = await daytona.create({
  envVars: { LETTA_API_KEY: process.env.SANDBOX_LETTA_API_KEY },
})
```

#### Running Letta Code in a Pseudoterminal

A [PTY (pseudoterminal)](/docs/en/pty/) is created for bidirectional communication with Letta Code:

```typescript
this.ptyHandle = await this.sandbox.process.createPty({
  id: `letta-pty-${Date.now()}`,
  onData: (data: Uint8Array) => this.handleData(data),
})
```

Letta Code is then launched in [bidirectional headless mode](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/headless/#bidirectional-mode) through the PTY. This mode uses stream-json format for both input and output, enabling programmatic control while maintaining real-time communication:

```typescript
await this.ptyHandle.sendInput(
  `letta --new --system-custom "${systemPrompt.replace(/"/g, '\\"')}" --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --yolo -p\n`,
)
```

The command passes a custom system prompt using the `--system-custom` flag. This prompt configures the agent with Daytona-specific instructions, including a URL pattern so the agent can generate preview links.

User prompts are sent to the agent as JSON messages:

```json
{"type": "user", "message": {"role": "user", "content": "create a simple web server"}}
```

The agent responds with streaming JSON messages. Tool calls arrive as incremental fragments:

```json
{"type": "message", "message_type": "approval_request_message", "tool_call": {"tool_call_id": "call_123", "name": "Bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"python3 -m http.server 8080\"}"}}
```

The program parses these streaming messages, extracts tool calls for display, and formats the final result with markdown rendering for the terminal.

#### Clean up

When you exit the main program, the Daytona sandbox and all files are automatically deleted.

**Key advantages:**

- Secure, isolated execution in Daytona sandboxes
- Stateful agents with persistent memory across sessions
- Full Letta Code capabilities including file operations and shell commands
- Agents can be viewed in [Letta's Agent Development Environment](https://app.letta.com/)
- Automatic preview link generation for hosted services
- Multi-language and full-stack support
- Simple setup and automatic cleanup
