title: Limits
---

Daytona enforces resource limits to ensure fair usage and stability across all organizations. Your organization has access to a compute pool consisting of:

- **vCPU** — Total CPU cores available
- **Memory** — Total RAM available
- **Storage** — Total disk space available

These resources are pooled and shared across all running Sandboxes.  
The number of Sandboxes you can run at once depends on how much CPU, RAM, and storage each one uses. You can see how to configure and estimate resource usage in the [Sandbox Management docs](https://www.daytona.io/docs/sandbox-management/).

## Tiers & Limit Increases

Organizations are automatically placed into a Tier based on verification status.  
You can unlock higher limits by completing the following steps:

| Tier   | Resources (vCPU / RAM / Storage) | Access Requirements                                                                                                     |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1 | 10 / 10GiB / 30GiB               | Email verified                                                                                                          |
| Tier 2 | 100 / 200GiB / 300GiB            | Credit card linked, $25 top-up, [GitHub connected](https://www.daytona.io/docs/linked-accounts#how-to-link-an-account). |
| Tier 3 | 250 / 500GiB / 2000GiB           | Business email verified, Phone verified, $500 top-up.                                                                   |
| Tier 4 | 500 / 1000GiB / 5000GiB          | $2000 top-up every 30 days.                                                                                             |
| Custom | Custom limits                    | Contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io)                                                                 |

### Manage usage dynamically

This is how different sandbox states affect your available resources:

- **Running:** Uses Compute, Memory, and Storage.
- **Stopped:** Frees up Compute and Memory, but uses Storage.
- **Archived:** Frees up all resources by moving data to cold storage.
- **Deleted:** Permanently removed, all resources freed.

Check your current usage and limits in the [Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/limits).
