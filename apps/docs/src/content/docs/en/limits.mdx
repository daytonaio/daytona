title: Limits
---

Daytona enforces resource limits to ensure fair usage and stability across all organizations. Your organization has access to a compute pool consisting of:

- **vCPU** — Total CPU cores available
- **Memory** — Total RAM available
- **Storage** — Total disk space available

Resources are shared across all running Sandboxes, so the number of Sandboxes you can run at once depends on their individual usage.

You can see default values and how to configure usage under [Sandbox Resources](/docs/en/sandbox-management/#sandbox-resources). Check your current usage and limits in the [Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/limits).

## Tiers & Limit Increases

Organizations are automatically placed into a Tier based on verification status.\
You can unlock higher limits by completing the following steps:

| Tier   | Resources (vCPU / RAM / Storage) | Access Requirements                                                                                                     |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1 | 10 / 10GiB / 30GiB               | Email verified                                                                                                          |
| Tier 2 | 100 / 200GiB / 300GiB            | Credit card linked, $25 top-up, [GitHub connected](/docs/en/linked-accounts#how-to-link-an-account). |
| Tier 3 | 250 / 500GiB / 2000GiB           | Business email verified, Phone verified, $500 top-up.                                                                   |
| Tier 4 | 500 / 1000GiB / 5000GiB          | $2000 top-up every 30 days.                                                                                             |
| Custom | Custom limits                    | Contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io)                                                                 |

Once you meet the criteria for a higher tier, make sure to Upgrade by clicking the "Upgrade" button in the [Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/limits).

## Manage usage dynamically

You can manage your resource usage by [changing the state](http://localhost:4321/docs/sandbox-management#sandbox-lifecycle) of your Sandboxes. The table below summarizes how each state affects resource usage:

| State      | vCPU | Memory | Storage | Notes                                                      |
|------------|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Running |   ✅    |   ✅     |  ✅   | Counts against all limits                                  |
| Stopped |   ❌    |   ❌     |  ✅   | Frees CPU & memory, but storage is still used                 |
| Archived|   ❌    |   ❌     |  ❌   | Data moved to cold storage, no quota impact                |
| Deleted |   ❌    |   ❌     |  ❌   | All resources freed                                        |
