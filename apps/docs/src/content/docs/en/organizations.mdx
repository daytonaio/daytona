Daytona provides organizations as a way to group resources and enable collaboration. Users can work individually in their personal organization or together in a collaborative organization.

Navigate to [Daytona Dashboard ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard) to manage your organizations.

## Personal vs Collaborative organizations

Every Daytona user starts with a personal organization, ideal for solo use and experimentation. Collaborative organizations are created manually and designed for company-wide collaboration with shared access and controls.

| **Feature**        | **Personal organization**        | **Collaborative organization**                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Creation**       | Automatic on signup              | Manually by a user                             |
| **Members**        | Single user only                 | Multiple users (invite-based)                  |
| **Access Control** | No roles or permissions          | Roles with granular resource-based assignments |
| **Billing**        | Tied to individual user          | Shared across team members                     |
| **Use Case**       | Personal testing, small projects | Company/team development and production        |
| **Quota Scope**    | Per user                         | Shared across all members                      |
| **Deletable**      | No                               | Yes (by Owner)                                 |

Users can switch between their personal and collaborative organizations by using the dropdown in the [Daytona Dashboard ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard) sidebar. Each organization has its own sandboxes, API keys, and resource quotas.

## Organization roles

Users within an organization can have one of two different roles:

1. **Owners** have full administrative access to the organization and its resources. Organization owners can perform administrative actions.
2. **Members** have no administrative access to the organization, while their access to organization resources is based on [**Assignments**](#available-assignments).

## Administrative actions

Organization owners can perform administrative actions such as:

- [Invite new users to the organization](#inviting-new-users)
- [Manage pending invitations](#managing-invitations)
- [Change role](#organization-roles) of a user in the Organization
- [Update assignments](#available-assignments) for organization members
- Remove user from the organization
- Inspect audit logs
- [Delete organization](#organization-settings)

## Manage members

### Invite new users

As an organization **Owner**, to invite a new user to your organization:

1. Navigate to [Members ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/members)
2. Click the **Invite Member** button
3. Enter the email address of the user you want to invite
4. [Select a role](#organization-roles) for the new user. If you select the **`Member`** role, define their [assignments](#available-assignments)

### Remove users

As an organization **Owner**, to remove a user from your organization:

1. Navigate to [Members ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/members)
2. Click the **Remove** button next to the user you want to remove
3. Confirm the removal by clicking the **Remove** button

## Manage invitations

To view pending invitations to join other organizations, navigate to [Invitations ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/invitations) page by expanding the dropdown at the bottom of the sidebar. 

Once a user accepts an invitation to join an organization, they get access to resource quotas assigned to that organization and they may proceed by issuing a new [API key](/docs/en/api-keys) and creating sandboxes.

## Organization settings

The [Settings](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/settings) subpage in the Dashboard allows you to view the Organization ID and Name and to delete the Organization if you don't need it anymore. This action is irreversible, so please proceed with caution. Personal Organizations are there by default and cannot be deleted.
