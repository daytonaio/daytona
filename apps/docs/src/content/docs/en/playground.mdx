Daytona provides an interactive environment ("Playground") for creating sandboxes, running SDK operations, and exploring Daytona features directly from your browser.

- **Interactive sandbox creation**: configure and create sandboxes with custom resources
- **Code snippet generation**: automatically generate SDK code samples for operations
- [Web terminal](/docs/en/web-terminal): run commands directly in your sandbox through a built-in web terminal
- [VNC access](/docs/en/vnc-access): interact with GUI applications using [Computer Use](/docs/en/computer-use) features

## Access from Dashboard

Navigate to [Daytona Dashboard ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/playground) to access the playground.

Playground consists of three tabs: [Sandbox](#sandbox-tab), [Terminal](#terminal-tab), and [VNC](#vnc-tab). All three tabs operate on the same active sandbox.

## Sandbox

The sandbox tab provides an interactive interface to configure sandboxes and perform SDK operations. The left panel contains configurable parameters organized into collapsible sections. The right panel displays auto-generated code snippets that you can inspect, copy, and run.

### Management

The management section contains the parameters used to configure a sandbox. You can edit these parameters to customize your sandbox and its resources.

- [sandbox language](/docs/en/sandboxes#multiple-runtime-support): select a programming language runtime for the sandbox
- [sandbox resources](/docs/en/sandboxes#resources): configure resources allocated to the sandbox
- [sandbox lifecycle](/docs/en/sandboxes#sandbox-lifecycle): set the sandbox lifecycle policies

:::note
If there are no active sandboxes, the playground automatically creates one using the configured parameters. Clicking **Run** always creates a new sandbox, replacing any existing playground sandbox.

### File system

The file system section provides operations to manage files and directories in the sandbox. You can modify files and directories in the sandbox using the following operations:

- **Create a new directory**: set the directory location and its permissions
- **List files and directories**: set the directory location
- **Delete files**: set the file location and delete directory checkbox

For more information, see [file system operations](/docs/en/file-system-operations).

### Git operations

The Git operations section provides operations to manage Git repositories in the sandbox. You can clone, get repository status, and list branches using the following operations:

- **Clone a Git repository**: set the repository URL, destination, branch, commit ID, and credentials
- **Get repository status**: retrieve the repository status
- **List branches**: retrieve the list of branches in the repository

For more information, see [Git operations](/docs/en/git-operations).

### Process and code execution

The process and code execution section provides operations to run code snippets and shell commands directly in the sandbox.

For more information, see [process and code execution](/docs/en/process-code-execution).

## Terminal

The terminal tab provides a web-based terminal connected to the sandbox. This gives you direct command-line access to the sandbox environment for running commands, viewing files, and debugging.

The terminal runs on port `22222` and remains active as long as the sandbox is running. If the sandbox stops due to inactivity, start it again to restore terminal access.

:::note
Terminal access is restricted to authenticated members of your [organization](/docs/en/organizations).

For more information, see [web terminal](/docs/en/web-terminal).

## VNC

The VNC tab provides graphical desktop access to the sandbox, enabling you to interact with GUI applications and test [Computer Use](/docs/en/computer-use) features. The left panel contains interaction controls organized into sections. The right panel displays the desktop view.

Interact with the desktop environment using the following options:

- **Display**: get information about the displays and list open windows
- **Keyboard**: press a hotkey combination, press a key with optional modifiers, and type text
- **Mouse**: click, drag, move, and get cursor position
- **Screenshot**: select format, scale, and quality, show cursor, and take screenshots of the entire screen or specific regions

For more information, see [VNC access](/docs/en/vnc-access) and [computer use](/docs/en/computer-use).
