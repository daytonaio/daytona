title: Regions & Runners

import { TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Sandboxes are isolated runtime environments that run on **runners** — machines that form Daytona's compute plane.

Runners are organized into **regions**, which are geographic or logical groupings of compute infrastructure. When creating a sandbox, you can target a specific region, and Daytona will schedule your workload on an available runner within that region.

As a result, you’re able to:

- Choose specific geographic locations for reduced latency
- Comply with data residency requirements
- Use your own runner machines for custom regions
- Scale compute resources independently within each custom region

## Regions

Regions are geographic or logical groupings of runners that execute sandbox workloads. The sandbox region is specified by setting the `target` parameter on initialization:

<Tabs syncKey="language">
<TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```python
from daytona import Daytona, DaytonaConfig

# Configure Daytona to use the US region
config = DaytonaConfig(
    target="us"
)

# Initialize the Daytona client with the specified configuration
daytona = Daytona(config)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
```typescript
import { Daytona } from '@daytonaio/sdk';

// Configure Daytona to use the EU region
const daytona: Daytona = new Daytona({
    target: "eu"
});
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Shared Regions

Shared regions are managed by Daytona and available to all organizations. These regions provide immediate access to Daytona's infrastructure without any setup required.

Limits are applied to your organization's default region. For access to a different shared region, please contact [sales@daytona.io](mailto:sales@daytona.io).

| Region        | Target |
| ------------- | ------ |
| United States | `us`   |
| Europe        | `eu`   |

### Dedicated Regions

Dedicated regions are managed by Daytona and provisioned exclusively for individual organizations. These regions deliver dedicated infrastructure with the operational simplicity of a managed service.

Contact [sales@daytona.io](mailto:sales@daytona.io) to set up a dedicated region for your organization.

### Custom Regions

Custom regions are created and managed by your organization, allowing you to use your own runner machines and scale compute resources independently within each region. This provides maximum control over data locality, compliance, and infrastructure configuration. 

Additionally, custom regions have no limits applied for concurrent resource usage, giving you full control over capacity and performance.

:::caution
Custom regions are currently an experimental feature and may change in future releases.
To request access, please contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io).
:::

#### Custom Region Configuration

**name** (required)

- A unique identifier for your region
- Must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, and hyphens
- Used for targeting this region when creating a sandbox

**proxyUrl** (optional)

- The URL of the proxy service that routes traffic to sandboxes in this region
- Required if the runner machines in this region are deployed in a private network

**sshGatewayUrl** (optional)

- The URL of the SSH gateway that handles SSH connections to sandboxes in this region
- Required if the runner machines in this region are deployed in a private network

#### Custom Region API Keys

When you create a custom region, Daytona will provide you with the following credentials:

- A **Proxy API key** that should be used by your proxy service to authenticate with Daytona
- An **SSH gateway API key** that should be used by your SSH gateway service to authenticate with Daytona

:::note
If needed, these API keys can always be regenerated, but you will need to redeploy your proxy and SSH gateway services with the updated credentials.

## Runners

Runners are machines that power Daytona's compute plane, providing the underlying infrastructure for running sandbox workloads. Each runner is responsible for:

- **Workload Execution** — Running sandbox workloads
- **Resource Management** — Allocating and monitoring CPU, memory, and disk resources
- **Health Reporting** — Continuously reporting metrics and health status to the Daytona control plane
- **Network Connectivity** — Managing networking, proxy connections, and SSH access for sandboxes

Runners in **shared** and **dedicated** regions are fully managed by Daytona — from provisioning and maintenance to monitoring and scaling. For **custom** regions, you bring your own runner machines and are responsible for their management and operation.

### Custom Runners

Custom runners are created and managed by your organization, allowing you to use your own runner machines and scale compute resources independently within each custom region.

:::caution
Custom runners are currently an experimental feature and may change in future releases.
To request access, please contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io).
:::

#### Custom Runner Configuration

**name** (required)

- A unique identifier for the runner
- Must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, and hyphens
- Helps distinguish between multiple runners in the same region

**regionId** (required)

- The ID of the region this runner is assigned to
- Must be a custom region owned by your organization
- All runners in a region share the region's proxy and SSH gateway configuration

#### Custom Runner Token

When you create a custom runner, Daytona will provide you with a **token** that should be used by your runner to authenticate with Daytona.

:::note
Save this token securely. You won't be able to see it again.
:::


#### Installing the Custom Runner

After registering a custom runner and obtaining its secure token, you need to install and configure the Daytona runner application on your infrastructure.

:::note
Detailed installation instructions for the runner application will be provided in a future update. For assistance with runner installation, please contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io).
