Sandboxes are isolated runtime environments that run on **runners** — machines that form Daytona's compute plane.

Runners are organized into **regions**, which are geographic or logical groupings of compute infrastructure. When creating a sandbox, you can target a specific region, and Daytona will schedule your workload on an available runner within that region.

As a result, you’re able to:

- Choose specific geographic locations for reduced latency
- Comply with data residency requirements
- Use your own runner machines for custom regions
- Scale compute resources independently within each custom region

## Regions

Regions are geographic or logical groupings of runners that execute sandbox workloads. The sandbox region is specified by setting the `target` parameter on initialization:

<Tabs syncKey="language">
<TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```python
from daytona import Daytona, DaytonaConfig

# Configure Daytona to use the US region
config = DaytonaConfig(
    target="us"
)

# Initialize the Daytona client with the specified configuration
daytona = Daytona(config)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
```typescript
import { Daytona } from '@daytonaio/sdk';

// Configure Daytona to use the EU region
const daytona: Daytona = new Daytona({
    target: "eu"
});
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Shared Regions

Shared regions are managed by Daytona and available to all organizations. These regions provide immediate access to Daytona's infrastructure without any setup required.

Limits are applied to your organization's default region. For access to a different shared region, please contact [sales@daytona.io](mailto:sales@daytona.io).

| Region        | Target |
| ------------- | ------ |
| United States | `us`   |
| Europe        | `eu`   |

### Dedicated Regions

Dedicated regions are managed by Daytona and provisioned exclusively for individual organizations. These regions deliver dedicated infrastructure with the operational simplicity of a managed service.

Contact [sales@daytona.io](mailto:sales@daytona.io) to set up a dedicated region for your organization.

### Custom Regions

Custom regions are created and managed by your organization, allowing you to use your own runner machines and scale compute resources independently within each region. This provides maximum control over data locality, compliance, and infrastructure configuration.

Additionally, custom regions have no limits applied for concurrent resource usage, giving you full control over capacity and performance.

:::caution
Custom regions are currently an experimental feature and may change in future releases.
To request access, please contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io).

#### Custom Region Configuration

**name** (required)

- A unique identifier for your region
- Must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, and hyphens
- Used for targeting this region when creating a sandbox

**proxyUrl** (optional)

- The URL of the proxy service that routes traffic to sandboxes in this region
- Required if the runner machines in this region are deployed in a private network

**sshGatewayUrl** (optional)

- The URL of the SSH gateway that handles SSH connections to sandboxes in this region
- Required if the runner machines in this region are deployed in a private network

**snapshotManagerUrl** (optional)

- The URL of the snapshot manager that handles storage and retrieval of snapshots in this region
- Required if the runner machines in this region are deployed in a private network

#### Custom Region Credentials

When you create a custom region, Daytona will provide credentials for any optional services you configure:

- An API key that should be used by your proxy service to authenticate with Daytona
- An API key that should be used by your SSH gateway service to authenticate with Daytona
- Basic authentication credentials that Daytona uses to access your snapshot manager service

:::note
If needed, these credentials can always be regenerated, but you will need to redeploy the corresponding services with the updated credentials.
