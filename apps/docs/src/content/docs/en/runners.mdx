title: Customer Managed Compute
---

import { TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Customer Managed Compute is a feature that allows you to use your own runner machines to run sandbox workloads. Runners are machines that power Daytona's compute plane and provide the underlying infrastructure. Each runner is responsible for:

- **Workload execution**: running sandbox workloads
- **Resource management**: allocating and monitoring CPU, memory, and disk resources
- **Health reporting**: providing metrics and health status to the Daytona control plane
- **Network connectivity**: managing sandbox networking, proxy connections, and SSH access

Runners in [shared](/docs/en/regions#shared-regions) and [dedicated](/docs/en/regions#dedicated-regions) regions are fully managed by Daytona — from provisioning and maintenance to monitoring and scaling. For custom regions, you bring your own runner machines and are responsible for their management and operation.

:::caution
Custom runners are currently an experimental feature and may change in future releases.
To request access, please contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io).

## Custom regions

Custom regions are created and managed by your organization, allowing you to use your own runner machines and scale compute resources independently within each region. This provides maximum control over data locality, compliance, and infrastructure configuration.

Additionally, custom regions have no limits applied for concurrent resource usage, giving you full control over capacity and performance.

### Custom region configuration

**name** (required)

- A unique identifier for your region
- Must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, and hyphens
- Used for targeting this region when creating a sandbox

**proxyUrl** (optional)

- The URL of the proxy service that routes traffic to sandboxes in this region
- Required if the runner machines in this region are deployed in a private network

**sshGatewayUrl** (optional)

- The URL of the SSH gateway that handles SSH connections to sandboxes in this region
- Required if the runner machines in this region are deployed in a private network

**snapshotManagerUrl** (optional)

- The URL of the snapshot manager that handles storage and retrieval of snapshots in this region
- Required if the runner machines in this region are deployed in a private network

### Create a custom region

Daytona provides an API to programmatically create a custom region.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="API" icon="seti:json">

```bash
curl https://app.daytona.io/api/regions \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN' \
  --data '{
    "name": "my-custom-region",
    "proxyUrl": "https://proxy.example.com",
    "sshGatewayUrl": "ssh://ssh-gateway.example.com",
    "snapshotManagerUrl": "https://snapshot-manager.example.com"
  }'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The response includes the region ID and credentials for any optional services you configured:

```json
{
  "id": "region_12345",
  "proxyApiKey": "proxy-api-key-xyz",
  "sshGatewayApiKey": "ssh-gateway-api-key-abc",
  "snapshotManagerUsername": "daytona",
  "snapshotManagerPassword": "generated-password"
}
```

For more information, see the [API](/docs/en/tools/api#daytona/tag/organizations) reference:

> [**createRegion (API)**](/docs/en/tools/api#daytona/tag/organizations/POST/regions)

### Custom region credentials

When you create a custom region, Daytona will provide credentials for any optional services you configure:

- An API key that should be used by your proxy service to authenticate with Daytona
- An API key that should be used by your SSH gateway service to authenticate with Daytona
- Basic authentication credentials that Daytona uses to access your snapshot manager service

:::note
If needed, these credentials can always be regenerated, but you will need to redeploy the corresponding services with the updated credentials.
