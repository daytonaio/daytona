title: Compute Managed Instances
---

Runners are machines that power Daytona's compute plane, providing the underlying infrastructure for running sandbox workloads. Each runner is responsible for:

- **Workload Execution** — Running sandbox workloads
- **Resource Management** — Allocating and monitoring CPU, memory, and disk resources
- **Health Reporting** — Continuously reporting metrics and health status to the Daytona control plane
- **Network Connectivity** — Managing networking, proxy connections, and SSH access for sandboxes

Runners in **shared** and **dedicated** regions are fully managed by Daytona — from provisioning and maintenance to monitoring and scaling. For **custom** regions, you bring your own runner machines and are responsible for their management and operation.

### Custom Runners

Custom runners are created and managed by your organization, allowing you to use your own runner machines and scale compute resources independently within each custom region.

:::caution
Custom runners are currently an experimental feature and may change in future releases.
To request access, please contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io).

#### Custom Runner Configuration

**name** (required)

- A unique identifier for the runner
- Must contain only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, and hyphens
- Helps distinguish between multiple runners in the same region

**regionId** (required)

- The ID of the region this runner is assigned to
- Must be a custom region owned by your organization
- All runners in a region share the region's proxy and SSH gateway configuration

#### Custom Runner Token

When you create a custom runner, Daytona will provide you with a **token** that should be used by your runner to authenticate with Daytona.

:::note
Save this token securely. You won't be able to see it again.
:::

#### Installing the Custom Runner

After registering a custom runner and obtaining its secure token, you need to install and configure the Daytona runner application on your infrastructure.

:::note
Detailed installation instructions for the runner application will be provided in a future update. For assistance with runner installation, please contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io).
