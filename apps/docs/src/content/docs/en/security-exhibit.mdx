:::

## Information security program

Daytona maintains a comprehensive information security program designed to protect Customer data processed through its secure runtime platform. The program is aligned with industry-standard frameworks including SOC 2, ISO 27001, and incorporates controls specific to AI agent infrastructure and ephemeral compute environments.

### Security policies

Daytona maintains a suite of information security policies that are reviewed at least annually and updated as needed by the Chief Trust Officer. These policies are approved by executive leadership and are made available to all Daytona personnel. Policies cover, at minimum: acceptable use, access control, data classification, incident response, vulnerability management, change management, and business continuity.

### Security training

All Daytona personnel with access to Customer data or production systems complete mandatory security awareness training during onboarding and annually thereafter. Training covers phishing recognition, secure coding practices, data handling procedures, incident reporting, and compliance obligations. Completion is tracked and verified.

### Personnel security

Background checks are conducted on all Daytona personnel who have access to Customer data or production systems, in accordance with applicable law. All such personnel are bound by confidentiality agreements. Offboarding procedures include timely revocation of all access credentials and return of company assets.

### Access control

Access to Customer data and production systems is governed by the principle of least privilege and role-based access control (RBAC). Access is granted only upon documented business need and approved by management. Access reviews are conducted quarterly. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced for all Daytona personnel with access to production infrastructure, administrative consoles, and source code repositories.

### Data storage and classification

Daytona classifies data according to sensitivity levels: Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted. Customer data is classified as Confidential at minimum. Data retention and destruction follow documented policies. Customer data is stored in the geographic region specified by the Customer's configuration where supported. Daytona does not use Customer Content to train models or improve services.

### Sandbox isolation

Daytona's core architecture isolates each sandbox using container and/or microVM technology, ensuring that one Customer's runtime environment cannot interact with another's. Isolation controls include: dedicated namespaces per sandbox, network segmentation preventing lateral movement between sandboxes, resource quotas (CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth), read-only root filesystems where applicable, and configurable network allow-lists with network-level firewall rules.

### Ephemeral sandbox supported

Daytona sandboxes can be configured as ephemeral, meaning they are automatically deleted once stopped. When ephemeral mode is enabled, all associated compute, memory, and local storage are reclaimed upon sandbox termination, and any session-scoped credentials or tokens are revoked. This reduces the attack surface by ensuring no persistent runtime state accumulates between sessions. For non-ephemeral sandboxes, Daytona provides configurable auto-stop and auto-delete intervals to manage sandbox lifecycle and minimize exposure of idle environments.

### Encryption

Encryption StandardsIn transit: TLS 1.2+ for all external and internal communications
At rest: AES-256 or equivalent across all storage systems
Key management: Infrastructure provider KMS with automatic rotation

### Authentication and access

Daytona provides identity and access management through Auth0, supporting authentication via Google and GitHub identity providers. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced for all Daytona personnel with administrative access. Daytona implements session management controls including configurable session timeouts and token revocation capabilities. Enterprise customers requiring SAML 2.0 or OIDC-based Single Sign-On (SSO) integration should contact Daytona to discuss available options.

### Backup and recovery

Critical Daytona platform data (control plane, configuration, metadata) is backed up regularly with a defined recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO). Backups are encrypted at rest and stored in a geographically separate location from the primary infrastructure. Backup restoration procedures are tested at least annually.

### Vulnerability management

Daytona performs automated vulnerability scanning of its infrastructure and applications on at least a monthly basis. Identified vulnerabilities are triaged and remediated according to the following target timelines:

| **Severity** | **Target** | **Example**                |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Critical     | 24 hours   | RCE, privilege escalation  |
| High         | 7 days     | Auth bypass, data exposure |
| Medium       | 30 days    | XSS, misconfigurations     |
| Low          | 90 days    | Informational findings     |

### Network security

Daytona implements defense-in-depth network security controls including: network segmentation between sandbox traffic, control plane, and management interfaces; firewall rules reviewed at least annually; DDoS mitigation at the infrastructure edge; and intrusion detection and monitoring for anomalous network activity. Sandbox network access can be restricted using configurable allow-lists and network block policies.

### Secure development lifecycle

Daytona follows a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) that includes: security requirements analysis during design, peer code review for all changes, automated static analysis and dependency scanning in CI/CD, container image scanning that blocks critical and high vulnerabilities, and separation of development, staging, and production environments.

### Change management

All changes to production systems follow a documented change management process that includes: description and risk assessment of the change, peer review and approval, testing in non-production environments, and rollback procedures. Emergency changes follow an expedited process with retroactive documentation and review.

### Third-party risk management

Daytona evaluates the security posture of third-party vendors and sub-processors before engagement and on an ongoing basis. Evaluation criteria include: security certifications, data handling practices, incident response capabilities, and contractual security obligations. Sub-processors are contractually required to maintain security controls substantially similar to those described in this Exhibit and the DPA.

### Patch management

Daytona applies security patches to operating systems, libraries, and application dependencies in accordance with its vulnerability management SLAs. Critical patches are tested and deployed within 24 hours. Automated dependency monitoring tracks new CVEs affecting the Daytona stack.

### Audit logging and monitoring

Daytona maintains comprehensive audit logs of administrative actions, authentication events, access to Customer data, and system-level events. Logs are stored securely, protected against tampering, and retained for a minimum of 12 months. Security events are monitored and alerted upon in real time. Log access is restricted to authorized security personnel.

### Container and runtime security

:::note
Daytona uses Sysbox as its container runtime to provide VM-level isolation without hardware virtualization overhead.
:::

Sysbox enforces Linux user-namespaces on all sandboxes, ensuring that the root user inside a sandbox maps to a fully unprivileged user on the host. Each sandbox receives exclusive user-ID and group-ID mappings, so a process escaping one sandbox has no permissions to access other sandboxes or host resources.

Additional Sysbox security controls include: partial virtualization of procfs and sysfs to hide host information and prevent modification of system-wide kernel settings, immutable initial mounts that prevent sandbox processes from weakening container isolation even with root capabilities, and selective syscall interception that blocks dangerous operations while preserving compatibility with system-level workloads such as Docker-in-Docker.

Container images are built from minimal base images and scanned for vulnerabilities in CI/CD pipelines, and runtime threat detection monitors for anomalous process behavior.

### Penetration testing

Daytona completes penetration testing at least annually, conducted by a recognized independent third party. Testing scope includes the Daytona platform, APIs, sandbox isolation mechanisms, and control plane. A summary of test results and remediation status is available to Customers upon request.

## Compliance and certifications

Daytona pursues and maintains industry-recognized compliance certifications to demonstrate its commitment to security and data protection.
