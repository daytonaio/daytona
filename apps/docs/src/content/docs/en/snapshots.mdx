Snapshots are Sandbox templates that can be created from [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) compatible images. New Sandboxes can be created from a custom Snapshot pre-configured with your required dependencies, settings, and resources, or from the [default Snapshot](#default-snapshot).

## Creating Snapshots

Snapshots can be created in one of four ways: [from a public image](#using-a-public-image), [from a private image](#using-private-registries), [from a local image](#using-a-local-image), or [using the Declarative Builder](#using-the-declarative-builder).

### Using a Public Image

To create a Snapshot from a public image, follow these steps:

1. Visit the Dashboard and click on [Snapshots](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/snapshots)
2. Click on **Create Snapshot**
3. Enter the name and tag of any publicly accessible image from Docker Hub (e.g. `alpine:3.21.3`) or from another public container registry (e.g. `my-public-registry.com/custom-alpine:3.21`)

Optionally, set the entrypoint field. If the image does not have a long-running entrypoint, Daytona will automatically run `sleep infinity` to prevent the container from exiting immediately.

:::note
Since images tagged `latest` get frequent updates, only specific tags (e.g. `0.1.0`) are supported. Same idea applies to tags such as `lts` or `stable` and we recommend avoiding those when defining an image.
:::

Once the Snapshot is pulled, validated and has an `Active` state, it is ready to be used.

### Images from Private Registries

To create a Snapshot from an image that is available in a private container registry:

1. Go to the [Registries](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/registries) page in the Dashboard
2. Click the **Add Registry** button.
3. Fill out the form with an appropriate custom name, URL, username, password, and project (if applicable)
4. Once the Container Registry is created, you may go back to the [Snapshots](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/snapshots) page
5. When creating the Snapshot, make sure to input the entire private image name, including the registry location and project name (e.g. `my-private-registry.com/<my-project>/custom-alpine:3.21`)

The next step is the same; simply set the `CreateSandboxFromSnapshotParams` field to use the custom Snapshot and no further authentication is needed.

#### Using a Private Docker Hub Image

To use a private Docker Hub image, you'll need to [add a Container Registry](/docs/en/snapshots#images-from-private-registries) with your Docker Hub credentials:

- **Registry URL**: Set this to `docker.io`
- **Username**: Enter your Docker Hub username (the account with access to the private image)
- **Password**: Use a [Docker Hub Personal Access Token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) (not your account password)
- **Create the Snapshot**: Once the registry is added, you can create a Snapshot using the full image path as the image name: `docker.io/<username>/<image>:<tag>`

### Using a Local Image

In order to avoid having to manually set up a private container registry and push your image there, the [Daytona CLI](/docs/en/getting-started#setting-up-the-daytona-cli) allows you to create a Snapshot from your local image or from a local Dockerfile and use it in your Sandboxes.

To create a Snapshot from a local image:

1. Run `docker images` to ensure the image and tag you want to use is available
2. Run `daytona snapshot push <your_local_docker_image>` to create a Snapshot and push it to Daytona, e.g.:

```bash
daytona snapshot push custom-alpine:3.21 --name alpine-minimal
```

:::tip
Use the flags `--cpu`, `--memory` and `--disk` to specify the resources you want the underlying Sandboxes to have

For example `daytona snapshot push custom-alpine:3.21 --name alpine-minimal --cpu 2 --memory 4 --disk 8` will create Alpine Sandboxes with 2 vCPU, 4GiB of memory and 8GiB of disk space.
:::

:::note
Daytona expects the local image to be built for AMD64 architecture. Therefore, the `--platform=linux/amd64` flag is required when building the Docker image if your machine is running on a different architecture.

For more information, see the [CLI documentation](/docs/en/tools/cli#daytona-snapshot-push).
:::

Alternatively, to do it through the CLI, use the `--dockerfile` flag under `create` to pass the path to the Dockerfile you want to use and Daytona will build the Snapshot for you. The COPY/ADD commands will be automatically parsed and added to the context - to manually add files to the context you can use the `--context` flag.

```bash
daytona snapshot create data-analysis01 --dockerfile ./Dockerfile
```

```text
Building image from /Users/idagelic/docs/Dockerfile
Step 1/5 : FROM alpine:latest

...

 ⡿  Waiting for the Snapshot to be validated ...

 ...

 ✓  Use 'harbor-transient.internal.daytona.app/daytona/trying-daytona:0.0.1' to create a new sandbox using this Snapshot

```

### Using the Declarative Builder

The declarative builder allows you to define your Snapshots using a code-first approach. See [Declarative Builder](/docs/declarative-builder) for more information.

### Specifying Resources

Snapshots can be customized with specific resource requirements. By default, Daytona Sandboxes come with **1 vCPU**, **1GB RAM**, and **3GiB disk**.

To customize these resources, use the `Resources` class to define exactly what you need:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```python
from daytona import (
    Daytona,
    CreateSnapshotParams,
    Image,
    Resources,
)

daytona = Daytona()

# Create a Snapshot with custom resources
daytona.snapshot.create(
    CreateSnapshotParams(
        name="my-snapshot",
        image=Image.debian_slim("3.12"),
        # All resource parameters are optional:
        resources=Resources(
          cpu=2,
          memory=4,
          disk=8,
        ),
    ),
    on_logs=print,
)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
```typescript
import { Daytona, Image } from "@daytonaio/sdk";

const daytona = new Daytona();

// Create a Snapshot with custom resources
await daytona.snapshot.create(
  {
    name: "my-snapshot",
    image: Image.debianSlim("3.13"),
    // All resource parameters are optional:
    resources: {
      cpu: 2,
      memory: 4,
      disk: 8,
    },
  },
  { onLogs: console.log }
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Check your available resources and limits in the [dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/limits).

## Using Snapshots

To use a Snapshot in your Sandbox, specify the `snapshot` field in the `CreateSandboxFromSnapshotParams` object:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Python" icon="seti:python">
```python
sandbox = daytona.create(CreateSandboxFromSnapshotParams(
    snapshot="my-snapshot-name",
))
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript" icon="seti:typescript">
```typescript
const sandbox = await daytona.create({
  snapshot: "my-snapshot-name",
})
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For examples of running code inside a sandbox, see the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/en/getting-started/#run-code-inside-a-sandbox).

## Deleting Snapshots

To delete custom Snapshots:

1. Go to the [Snapshots](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/snapshots) page
2. Click the three dots at the end of the row for the Snapshot you want to delete
3. Click the `Delete` button that appears

:::tip

To temporarily disable a Snapshot, instead of deleting, you can click `Disable`. This will prevent the Snapshot from being used in any new Sandboxes but will not delete it.

:::

## Running Docker in a Sandbox

Daytona Sandboxes can run Docker containers inside them (**Docker-in-Docker**), enabling you to build, test, and deploy containerized applications. This is particularly useful when your projects have dependencies on external services like databases, message queues, or other microservices.

Agents can seamlessly interact with these services since they run within the same sandbox environment, providing better isolation and security compared to external service dependencies.

### Creating a DinD Snapshot

You can create a Snapshot with Docker support using pre-built Docker-in-Docker images as a base or by manually installing Docker in a custom image.

#### Using Pre-built Images

The following base images are widely used for creating Docker-in-Docker snapshots or can be used as a base for a custom Dockerfile:

- `docker:28.3.3-dind` - Official Docker-in-Docker image (Alpine-based, lightweight)
- `docker:28.3.3-dind-rootless` - Rootless Docker-in-Docker for enhanced security
- `docker:28.3.2-dind-alpine3.22` - Docker-in-Docker image with Alpine 3.22

#### Manual Docker Installation

Alternatively, you can install Docker manually in a custom Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
# Install Docker using the official install script
RUN curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | VERSION=28.3.3 sh -
```

### Use Cases

- Run databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL) and other services
- Build and test containerized applications
- Deploy microservices and their dependencies
- Create isolated development environments with full container orchestration

:::note
Docker-in-Docker Sandboxes require additional resources due to the Docker daemon overhead. Consider allocating at least 2 vCPU and 4GiB of memory for optimal performance.
