title: VNC Access
---

VNC access provides a graphical desktop environment for your Daytona Sandbox directly in your browser. This allows you to interact with GUI applications, desktop tools, and visual interfaces running inside your sandbox.

- **GUI Application Development**: Build and test desktop applications with visual interfaces
- **Browser Testing**: Run and debug web applications in a full browser environment
- **Visual Debugging**: Inspect graphical output and UI behavior in real-time
- **Desktop Tool Access**: Use graphical IDEs, design tools, or other desktop software

## Access VNC

Daytona provides a method to access the VNC desktop environment from the Daytona Dashboard.

1. Navigate to [Daytona Sandboxes ↗](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/sandboxes)
2. Locate the sandbox you want to access via VNC
3. Click the options menu (**⋮**) next to the sandbox
4. Select **VNC** from the dropdown menu

This opens a VNC viewer in your browser with a **Connect** button.

5. Click **Connect** to establish the VNC session

Once connected, a full desktop environment loads in your browser, providing mouse and keyboard control over the sandbox's graphical interface.

:::note
VNC sessions remain active as long as the sandbox is running. If the sandbox auto-stops due to inactivity, you need to start the sandbox again before reconnecting via VNC.
