title: Webhooks
description: Connect your applications to Daytona events in real-time with webhooks for automation, monitoring, and integrations.
---

import { TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that Daytona sends to your specified endpoints when specific events occur.
Think of them as "reverse API calls" - instead of your application asking Daytona for updates, Daytona
proactively notifies your application when something important happens.

## Use Cases

Webhooks enable powerful automation and integration scenarios:

- **Real-time Notifications**: Get instant alerts when sandboxes are created, started, or stopped
- **Automated Workflows**: Trigger deployment pipelines when snapshots are created
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Track usage patterns and resource utilization across your organization
- **Integration**: Connect Daytona with your existing tools like Slack, Discord, or custom applications
- **Audit & Compliance**: Maintain detailed logs of all important changes

## Getting Started

### Accessing Webhooks

If you don't see **Webhooks** in your dashboard sidebar, contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io) to enable webhooks for your organization. Provide your organization ID (found in your organization settings) when requesting access.

Once webhooks are enabled for your organization:

1. Navigate to your [Daytona Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard)
2. Click **Webhooks** in the left sidebar
3. You'll be able to access the webhook management interface

:::note
Webhooks are available to organization admins and members with appropriate permissions.

## Managing Webhook Endpoints

### Creating Endpoints

2. Click **Add Endpoint**
3. Configure your endpoint:
   - **Endpoint URL**: The HTTPS endpoint where you want to receive events
   - **Description**: A helpful description for this endpoint
   - **Subscribe to events**: Select which events you want to receive

### Testing Endpoints

Before going live, test your webhook endpoints:

1. Select webhook from **Endpoints** list
2. Go to the **Testing** tab
3. Configure test event and send it
4. Verify your endpoint receives the test payload correctly
5. Check that your application handles the webhook format properly

## Available Events

Daytona sends webhooks for lifecycle events across your infrastructure resources. You can subscribe to specific event types or receive all events and filter them in your application.

##### Event Categories

- Sandbox Lifecycle Events
- Snapshot Lifecycle Events
- Volume Lifecycle Events

## Webhook Payload Format

All webhook events follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "event": "event.type",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

**Common Fields:**

- `event`: The type of event (e.g., "sandbox.created")
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the event occurred
- `data`: Event-specific payload containing relevant information

## Monitoring and Activity

### Activity

The **Activity** tab provides a visual overview of your webhook activity, including delivery statistics, event volume trends, and performance metrics to help you monitor the health of your webhook integrations.

### Event Logs

The **Logs** tab shows detailed information about webhook deliveries, including event history, delivery status, and retry information for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.
