Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that Daytona sends to your specified endpoints when specific events occur.
Think of them as "reverse API calls" - instead of your application asking Daytona for updates, Daytona
proactively notifies your application when something important happens.

Webhooks enable powerful automation and integration scenarios:

- **Real-time Notifications**: Get instant alerts when sandboxes are created, started, or stopped
- **Automated Workflows**: Trigger deployment pipelines when snapshots are created
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Track usage patterns and resource utilization across your organization
- **Integration**: Connect Daytona with your existing tools like Slack, Discord, or custom applications
- **Audit & Compliance**: Maintain detailed logs of all important changes

:::tip
Daytona provides a [webhooks API reference](/docs/en/tools/api/#daytona/tag/webhooks) to help you integrate webhooks into your application.

## Webhook events

Daytona sends webhooks for lifecycle events across your infrastructure resources. You can subscribe to specific event types or receive all events and filter them in your application.

- Sandbox lifecycle events
- Snapshot lifecycle events
- Volume lifecycle events

## Webhook payload format

Webhook payloads are JSON objects that contain the event data. You can use the [webhooks API reference](/docs/en/tools/api/#daytona/tag/webhooks) to parse the payload and extract the event data. All webhook payloads follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "event": "event.type",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    // event-specific data
  }
}
```

**Common Fields:**

- `event`: type of the event (e.g., "sandbox.created")
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the event occurred
- `data`: event-specific payload with relevant information
