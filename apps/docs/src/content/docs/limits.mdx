title: Limits
---

Daytona enforces resource limits to ensure fair usage and stability across all organizations. Your organization has access to a compute pool consisting of:

- **vCPU** â€” total CPU cores available
- **Memory** â€” total RAM available
- **Disk** â€” total disk space across sandboxes

These resources are pooled and shared across all running Sandboxes.  
The number of Sandboxes you can run at once depends on how much CPU, RAM, and disk each one uses. You can see how to configure and estimate resource usage in the [Sandbox Management docs](https://www.daytona.io/docs/sandbox-management/).

:::tip

### Manage usage dynamically

Only **Running** Sandboxes count against your vCPU, memory, and disk limits.  
Use **Stop**, **Archive**, or **Delete** to manage resources:

- **Stopped** Sandboxes free up CPU and memory but still consume disk.
- **Archived** Sandboxes free up all compute and move data to cold storage (no quota impact).
- **Deleted** Sandboxes are permanently removed and free up all resources, including disk.

Check your current usage and limits in the [Dashboard](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/limits).

## Tiers & Limit Increases

Organizations are automatically placed into a Tier based on verification status.  
You can unlock higher limits by completing the following steps:

| Tier   | Compute Pool (vCPU / RAM / Disk) | Access Requirements                                                                                                     |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1 | 10 / 10GiB / 30GiB               | Email verified                                                                                                          |
| Tier 2 | 100 / 200GiB / 300GiB            | Credit card linked, [GitHub connected](https://www.daytona.io/docs/linked-accounts#how-to-link-an-account), $10 top-up. |
| Tier 3 | Everything bigger ðŸš€             | Coming soon.                                                                                                            |
| Custom | Custom limits                    | Contact [support@daytona.io](mailto:support@daytona.io)                                                                 |

Youâ€™ll be automatically upgraded once you meet the criteria.
