Organizations in Daytona are used to group resources and enable collaboration. Users can work individually in their Personal Organization or together in a Collaborative Organization.

### Personal vs Collaborative Organizations

Every Daytona user starts with a **Personal Organization**, ideal for solo use and experimentation. **Collaborative Organizations** are created manually and designed for company-wide collaboration with shared access and controls.

| Feature | Personal Organization | Collaborative Organization |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------|
| **Creation** | Automatic on signup | Manually by a user |
| **Members** | Single user only | Multiple users (invite-based) |
| **Access Control** | No roles or permissions | Roles with granular resource-based Assignments |
| **Billing** | Tied to individual user | Shared across team members |
| **Use Case** | Personal testing, small projects | Company/team development and production |
| **Quota Scope** | Per user | Shared across all members |
| **Deletable** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (by Owner) |

Users can switch between their Personal and Collaborative Organizations using the dropdown in the sidebar. Each Organization has its own sandboxes, API keys, and resource quotas.

## Organization Roles

Users within an Organization can have one of two different **Roles**: `Owner` and `Member`. `Owners` have full
administrative access to the Organization and its resources. `Members` have no administrative access
to the Organization, while their access to Organization resources is based on **Assignments**.

### Administrative Actions

Organization `Owners` can perform administrative actions such as:

- Invite new users to the Organization
- Manage pending invitations
- Change Role of a user in the Organization
- Update Assignments for an Organization Member
- Remove user from the Organization
- Delete Organization

## Inviting New Users

As an Organization `Owner`, to invite a new user to your Organization, navigate to the _Members page_,
click on _Invite Member_, enter the email address of the user you want to invite, and choose a **Role**.
If you select the `Member` role, you can also define their **Assignments**.

## Available Assignments

The list of available **Assignments** includes:

| Assignment | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **`Viewer (required)`** | Grants read access to all resources in the organization |
| **`Developer`** | Grants the ability to create sandboxes and keys in the organization |
| **`Sandboxes Admin`** | Grants admin access to sandboxes in the organization |
| **`Snapshots Admin`** | Grants admin access to snapshots in the organization |
| **`Registries Admin`** | Grants admin access to registries in the organization |
| **`Super Admin`** | Grants full access to all resources in the organization |

## Managing Invitations

To view their pending invitations to join other Organizations, users can navigate to the _Invitations
page_ by expanding the dropdown at the bottom of the sidebar, and clicking on _Invitations_. Once a user
accepts an invitation to join an Organization, they get access to resource quotas assigned to that
Organization and they may proceed by issuing a new API key and creating sandboxes.

## Settings

The Settings subpage in the Dashboard allows you to view the Organization ID and Name and to delete the Organization if you don't need it anymore. This action is irreversible, so please proceed with caution. Personal Organizations are there by default and cannot be deleted.
