## AsyncFileSystem

```python
class AsyncFileSystem()
```

Provides file system operations within a Sandbox.

This class implements a high-level interface to file system operations that can
be performed within a Daytona Sandbox.

#### AsyncFileSystem.\_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(sandbox_id: str, toolbox_api: ToolboxApi,
             get_root_dir: Callable[[], Awaitable[str]])
```

Initializes a new FileSystem instance.

**Arguments**:

- `sandbox_id` _str_ - The Sandbox ID.
- `toolbox_api` _ToolboxApi_ - API client for Sandbox operations.
- `get_root_dir` _Callable[[], str]_ - A function to get the default root directory of the Sandbox.

#### AsyncFileSystem.create\_folder

```python
@intercept_errors(message_prefix="Failed to create folder: ")
async def create_folder(path: str, mode: str) -> None
```

Creates a new directory in the Sandbox at the specified path with the given
permissions.

**Arguments**:

- `path` _str_ - Path where the folder should be created. Relative paths are resolved based
  on the user's root directory.
- `mode` _str_ - Folder permissions in octal format (e.g., "755" for rwxr-xr-x).
  

**Example**:

```python
# Create a directory with standard permissions
await sandbox.fs.create_folder("workspace/data", "755")

# Create a private directory
await sandbox.fs.create_folder("workspace/secrets", "700")
```

#### AsyncFileSystem.delete\_file

```python
@intercept_errors(message_prefix="Failed to delete file: ")
async def delete_file(path: str) -> None
```

Deletes a file from the Sandbox.

**Arguments**:

- `path` _str_ - Absolute path to the file to delete.
  

**Example**:

```python
# Delete a file
await sandbox.fs.delete_file("workspace/data/old_file.txt")
```

#### AsyncFileSystem.download\_file

```python
@overload
async def download_file(remote_path: str, timeout: int = 30 * 60) -> bytes
```

Downloads a file from the Sandbox. Returns the file contents as a bytes object.
This method is useful when you want to load the file into memory without saving it to disk.
It can only be used for smaller files.

**Arguments**:

- `remote_path` _str_ - Path to the file in the Sandbox. Relative paths are resolved based on the user's
  root directory.
- `timeout` _int_ - Timeout for the download operation in seconds. 0 means no timeout. Default is 30 minutes.
  

**Returns**:

- `bytes` - The file contents as a bytes object.
  

**Example**:

```python
# Download and save a file locally
content = await sandbox.fs.download_file("workspace/data/file.txt")
with open("local_copy.txt", "wb") as f:
    f.write(content)

# Download and process text content
content = await sandbox.fs.download_file("workspace/data/config.json")
config = json.loads(content.decode('utf-8'))
```

#### AsyncFileSystem.download\_file

```python
@overload
async def download_file(remote_path: str,
                        local_path: str,
                        timeout: int = 30 * 60) -> None
```

Downloads a file from the Sandbox and saves it to a local file using stream.
This method is useful when you want to download larger files that may not fit into memory.

**Arguments**:

- `remote_path` _str_ - Path to the file in the Sandbox. Relative paths are resolved based on the user's
  root directory.
- `local_path` _str_ - Path to save the file locally.
- `timeout` _int_ - Timeout for the download operation in seconds. 0 means no timeout. Default is 30 minutes.
  

**Example**:

```python
local_path = "local_copy.txt"
await sandbox.fs.download_file("tmp/large_file.txt", local_path)
size_mb = os.path.getsize(local_path) / 1024 / 1024
print(f"Size of the downloaded file {local_path}: {size_mb} MB")
```

#### AsyncFileSystem.find\_files

```python
@intercept_errors(message_prefix="Failed to find files: ")
async def find_files(path: str, pattern: str) -> List[Match]
```

the destination path, it will be overwritten. This method is useful when you want to upload
small files that fit into memory.

**Arguments**:

- `file` _bytes_ - File contents as a bytes object.
- `remote_path` _str_ - Path to the destination file. Relative paths are resolved based on the user's
  root directory.
- `timeout` _int_ - Timeout for the upload operation in seconds. 0 means no timeout. Default is 30 minutes.

```python
# Upload a text file
content = b"Hello, World!"
await sandbox.fs.upload_file(content, "tmp/hello.txt")

# Upload a local file
with open("local_file.txt", "rb") as f:
    content = f.read()
await sandbox.fs.upload_file(content, "tmp/file.txt")

# Upload binary data
import json
data = {"key": "value"}
content = json.dumps(data).encode('utf-8')
await sandbox.fs.upload_file(content, "tmp/config.json")
```

#### AsyncFileSystem.upload\_file

```python
@overload
async def upload_file(local_path: str,
                      remote_path: str,
                      timeout: int = 30 * 60) -> None
```

Uploads a file from the local file system to the specified path in the Sandbox.
If a file already exists at the destination path, it will be overwritten. This method uses
streaming to upload the file, so it is useful when you want to upload larger files that may
not fit into memory.

**Arguments**:

- `local_path` _str_ - Path to the local file to upload.
- `remote_path` _str_ - Path to the destination file in the Sandbox. Relative paths are
  resolved based on the user's root directory.

**Example**:

```python
await sandbox.fs.upload_file("local_file.txt", "tmp/large_file.txt")
```

#### AsyncFileSystem.upload\_files

```python
@intercept_errors(message_prefix="Failed to upload files: ")
async def upload_files(files: List[FileUpload],
                       timeout: int = 30 * 60) -> None
```

Uploads multiple files to the Sandbox. If files already exist at the destination paths,
they will be overwritten.

**Arguments**:

- `files` _List[FileUpload]_ - List of files to upload.
- `timeout` _int_ - Timeout for the upload operation in seconds. 0 means no timeout. Default is 30 minutes.

**Example**:

```python
# Upload multiple text files
files = [
    FileUpload(
        source=b"Content of file 1",
        destination="/tmp/file1.txt"
    ),
    FileUpload(
        source="workspace/data/file2.txt",
        destination="/tmp/file2.txt"
    ),
    FileUpload(
        source=b'{"key": "value"}',
        destination="/tmp/config.json"
    )
]
await sandbox.fs.upload_files(files)
```


## FileUpload

```python
@dataclass
class FileUpload()
```

Represents a file to be uploaded to the Sandbox.

**Attributes**:

- `source` _Union[bytes, str]_ - File contents as a bytes object or a local file path. If a bytes object is provided,
  make sure it fits into memory, otherwise use the local file path which content will be streamed to the Sandbox.
- `destination` _str_ - Absolute destination path in the Sandbox. Relative paths are resolved based on the user's
  root directory.
